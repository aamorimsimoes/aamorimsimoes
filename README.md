I'm a recent graduate developer. I have some projects hosted, so feel free to check out. 
Currently with my fullstack course completed, I'm searching for a web developer job vacancy. In my free time I'm doing online courses such as advanced Javascript in order to consolidate knowledge.
I genuinely love learning, is something I find incredibly rewarding and challenging. 

So, if you know of any exciting opportunity that you feel would be a good fit please feel free to let me know.

Thanks for taking the time to go over my summary and if you'd like to see some of my work check out my portfolio.
